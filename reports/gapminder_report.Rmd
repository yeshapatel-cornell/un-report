This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.

```{r read-data}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```


```{r gdp-lifeExp-1997-plot}
# make plot of GDP vs LifeEXp

ggplot (data = gapminder_1997) +
aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent) +
  labs ( x= "GDP per Capital", y= "Life Expectancy") +
geom_point()+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
